**week one**

I learned that our job as programmers is to act as intermediaries between the hardware and the user to build something.The key difference between writing a program for someone else and writing a program for yourself to consume is the rigor. You don't have to be such a professional just to write code that you can use yourself. If it works and it gets you the data you want, then job done. If you want to become a professional programmer, then you have to study how to be more precise and more engineering.

I learned about the central processing unit, main memory, secondary memory unit, and input/output devices. Input and Output devices are things such as the keyboard, mouse and the computer screen. The CPU is a highly sophisticated circuit with millions of transistors on it, and you've probably heard that, millions of transistors. It runs maybe three billion instructions per second. When you write a program, you create a file on the secondary memory, like a Python file, and then at some point that is loaded into the main memory, and translated. Then when the CPU says what next, your program feeds its first instruction. Then the CPU feeds the second instruction, third instruction, fourth instruction. It's called the fetch-execute cycle. These two parts, the CPU and the main memory, are what participate.

Then I learned a little about python, Guido van Rossum, over 20 years ago, invented this Python language. Python turns out to be such a perfect language to use as your first programming language. I also learned that syntax error doesn't mean that Python thinks you're bad. It is not a judgement of your potential to be a programmer. Syntax error means Python is lost.

I worked for about 2 hours this week.

**week two**

I basically just learned how to download python into different computer systems like Windows and Apple. If we cant download python for some reason they gave us access to a "python playground" to use through out the course. They teach you how to switch from python 2 to python 3 so you can submit programs for the course but, also, switch between them both to see the difference. If you ever need help with your code you can sort of leave your code in the Playground then, you ask the teaching assistant, and then they go take a look at your code and give you some answers.

**week three**

This week we actually started learning how to write code. we started with a simple math equation like x = 1, then we told the program to print(x). the equal sign doesn't mean "equal to" it means that the variable before it is "assigned" to the string after. Then, we got a little more in depth and started to learn loops including while loops and for loops. Then, we coded nested if statements.
![nested loops](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412549/66088140-0e30dc80-e548-11e9-8400-8702fbdd1924.png)
Then we kind of back tracked to print ("Hello World!").

We were supposed to take a quiz but, it wouldn't let me submit it because I have to pay even though I audited it in the beginning... I still went through it and answered all the questions though, here are my Q&A's.
![quiz1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412549/66139532-9c4fa600-e5ce-11e9-8188-7778b2d43bd9.png)

**week four**

Generally in this week I learned how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information. I started learning all pythons reserved words like true, false, if, else, return, def, or, etc,.
![reserved words](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412549/66140048-6e1e9600-e5cf-11e9-9e11-e76deb4adb2b.png)

In the first exercise we assigned integers to variables and learned how to use operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc,. I also found out that python automatically uses PEMDAS. These were also listed on the COP 1500 course website
this is the link address

https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.learnpython.org%2Fen%2FBasic_Operators&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFBpFOLEJcNqxYYlG1Ipb8q9tkF5A

**Voacb**
Variable: memory location used to store a value. The value stored in a variable can be updated by replacing the old value with a new value.
Comments: describes what is going to happen in following code and is also ignored by python. (#)

Then, I learned a lot about string conversions and how you can use functions like int() and float() to convert between strings and integers. Finally I took the chapter 2 quiz, here is my answers
![coversions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412549/66143232-cc9a4300-e5d4-11e9-9573-8b427c3f18b5.png)

**week five**
In this section we moved from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped.

**Vocab**
boolean expressions: asks questions that produce a Yes/No or True/False result which we use to control program flow.

comparison operators:
![comparison operators](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412549/66151006-6d442f00-e5e4-11e9-96fa-05728aff6e23.png)
I found this exercise very helpful because it uses nested statements to produce an output and it easily shows the inner and outer loops
![pic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412549/66151380-2efb3f80-e5e5-11e9-89da-04ef63e831e0.png)
Something I really liked about this chapter is that fact that in each video lesson they show you how to start your algorithm in visual blocks like we used the first day of class. Then, you can easily translate your visual block to python code. For example,
![visual blocks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412549/66151773-fd36a880-e5e5-11e9-9c6f-3406b42826f6.png)
Lastly I took chapter 3 quiz:
![quiz3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412549/66152796-40921680-e5e8-11e9-990d-56f3b2af930a.png)

**week six**

this week is the start of chapter four, Sequential, conditional, iterations, and then store and reuse. def is the keyword, it ends in a colon, just like lots of things that start an indented block.Then after the def function coems the parameters that will be stored inside the parentheses. Basically, these functions are used so that we don't have to reuse code, we can just call it whenever we need it. 

Here is an example:
![screenshot1](file:///Users/ryliehurley/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-31%20at%208.33.59%20PM.png)

If you dont use the call funtion, the code WILL NOT show up. For example, in this program the 'lyrics' are not printed because the function was never called. 
![](file:///Users/ryliehurley/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-31%20at%208.42.55%20PM.png)

Here the lyrics ARE called into because the call statement was added. 
![](file:///Users/ryliehurley/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-31%20at%208.44.57%20PM.png)

Then we dove in a little deeper and learned about functions parameters. Now example really helped me understand how a parameter works. A parameter is really just a variable used to access arguments in a function. 
![](file:///Users/ryliehurley/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-31%20at%208.47.28%20PM.png)

We can define more than one parameter in a function definition, we simply add more arguments when we call the function, we match the number and order of arguments and parameters.

Lastly, I took my quiz for chapter 4:
![1](file:///Users/ryliehurley/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-31%20at%208.56.42%20PM.png)

![6](file:///Users/ryliehurley/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-31%20at%209.02.55%20PM.png)

**week seven**

This is the start of chapter 5 and where we learn about loops. One of the keywords is the while keyword and the for keyword. These loops are called indefinite loops. So while is a keyword and this is like an if statement, this is a question. Is n greater than 0? That's leads to a true or false answer. And if it is true, this code executes and if it is not true, the code is skipped. And in that respect, it is exactly the same as an if. You could say if n was greater than 0, run this code, otherwise skip this code. So if it's true in this case, n is 5, so it is true. So it runs this. It prints out 5, which prints that out and then subtracts 1 from n, which makes it 4. But with the while statement, it goes back up again.
![](file:///Users/ryliehurley/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-31%20at%209.13.23%20PM.png)

You can also add breaks in loops like in this example:
![breaks](file:///Users/ryliehurley/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-31%20at%209.15.26%20PM.png)

Basically the break just ends the current loop and jumps to the statement directly after it. Then, there is a 'continue' statement that ends the current iteration and jumps to the top of the loop and starts the next iteration. For example, 
![continue](file:///Users/ryliehurley/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-31%20at%209.15.26%20PM.png)

Since we talked about indefinte loops, we have to talk about definte loops. we use the "for" construct. And it's more predictable; and it's easier even to validate them because we have a set of things that we're going to go through, and it might be a lot, but we're going to go through all the things in the set. So here's a little loop, the for loop. So the for key – the for is the keyword. And so, while was the keyword for indefinite loops, and for is the key word for definite loops.
![definite loops](file:///Users/ryliehurley/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-31%20at%209.21.50%20PM.png)

in section 3 of chapter 5 we learned how to grab the largest number from a list using indefinite loops, here is an example: 
![largest](file:///Users/ryliehurley/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-31%20at%209.25.04%20PM.png)

Lastly, we talked about loops idioms. Boolean is another type of a variable. You've got integer variables, you've got string variables, you've got floating point variables. Boolean is another kind of variable. Boolean is a kind of variable that either has the value True or False, that's it, it can only have two. 
![boolean](file:///Users/ryliehurley/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-31%20at%209.29.04%20PM.png)

**week eight**

This week I started a PyCharm project that includes all the code I've learned from Python for Everybody. I worked on chapters 3-5 because the first two chapters I didn't really learn any actual code. I put all this code into one project so I can really track my improvement through-out the course. I spent about an hour an a half settings this up. Making a new PyCharm project refreshed my memory on how to actually make a PyCharm project because, I only ever made one during class for our integration project. I never did it on my own so, now I am confident in my Pycharm skills.

**week nine**

this week I finished writing all my code into my Pycharm Project and then, I used the editor to make sure my code was all formatted correctly. The code doesn't output nicely for someone else to understand but, the code I wrote with my comments will help me to have all my code in one spot and understand what I learned from this course. This took me about 2 hours to complete.

**week ten**

I went ahead and continued studying on my own using the knowledge I learn from the Python for Everybody course. I used W3Schools to review and expand my knowledge of Python. This week, I specifically looked at Tuples because I never learned it in class nor the course. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets. Once a tuple is created, it is unchangeable.

**Negative Indexing:** means beginning from the end, -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.
**Range of Indexes:** You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range. When specifying a range, the return value will be a new tuple with the specified items.
**Change Tuple Values:** Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called. But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.
**Tuple Methods:** Python has 2 built in functions you can use on Tuples; 
                   count():Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
                   index():Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found
also, len() can be used to output how many items are in a tuple.

this took me about 2 hours

**week eleven**

This week I decided to dive more into Try... Except's in Python. We learned a little in class but I used W3Schools to help expand my knowledge of them. The try block lets you test a block of code for errors. The except block lets you handle the error. The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks. When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message. These exceptions can be handled using the try statement. You can define as many exception blocks as you want, e.g. if you want to execute a special block of code for a special kind of error.
**Raise and exception:** As a Python developer you can choose to throw an exception if a condition occurs. To throw (or raise) an exception, use the raise keyword.
This took me an hour and a half

**week tweleve**

This week I focused on the string formatting section in W3Schools. The format() method allows you to format selected parts of a string. Sometimes there are parts of a text that you do not control, maybe they come from a database, or user input? To control such values, add placeholders (curly brackets {}) in the text, and run the values through the format() method. If you want to use more values, just add more values to the format() method. You can use index numbers (a number inside the curly brackets) to be sure the values are placed in the correct placeholders. You can also use named indexes by entering a name inside the curly brackets, but then you must use names when you pass the parameter values. 
I worked on this for 2 hours
