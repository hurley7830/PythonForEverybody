**week one**

I learned that our job as programmers is to act as intermediaries between the hardware and the user to build something.The key difference between writing a program for someone else and writing a program for yourself to consume is the rigor. You don't have to be such a professional just to write code that you can use yourself. If it works and it gets you the data you want, then job done. If you want to become a professional programmer, then you have to study how to be more precise and more engineering.

I learned about the central processing unit, main memory, secondary memory unit, and input/output devices. Input and Output devices are things such as the keyboard, mouse and the computer screen. The CPU is a highly sophisticated circuit with millions of transistors on it, and you've probably heard that, millions of transistors. It runs maybe three billion instructions per second. When you write a program, you create a file on the secondary memory, like a Python file, and then at some point that is loaded into the main memory, and translated. Then when the CPU says what next, your program feeds its first instruction. Then the CPU feeds the second instruction, third instruction, fourth instruction. It's called the fetch-execute cycle. These two parts, the CPU and the main memory, are what participate.

Then I learned a little about python, Guido van Rossum, over 20 years ago, invented this Python language. Python turns out to be such a perfect language to use as your first programming language. I also learned that syntax error doesn't mean that Python thinks you're bad. It is not a judgement of your potential to be a programmer. Syntax error means Python is lost.

I worked for about 2 hours this week.

**week two**

I basically just learned how to download python into different computer systems like Windows and Apple. If we cant download python for some reason they gave us access to a "python playground" to use through out the course. They teach you how to switch from python 2 to python 3 so you can submit programs for the course but, also, switch between them both to see the difference. If you ever need help with your code you can sort of leave your code in the Playground then, you ask the teaching assistant, and then they go take a look at your code and give you some answers.

**week three**

This week we actually started learning how to write code. we started with a simple math equation like x = 1, then we told the program to print(x). the equal sign doesn't mean "equal to" it means that the variable before it is "assigned" to the string after. Then, we got a little more in depth and started to learn loops including while loops and for loops. Then, we coded nested if statements.
![nested loops](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412549/66088140-0e30dc80-e548-11e9-8400-8702fbdd1924.png)
Then we kind of back tracked to print ("Hello World!").

We were supposed to take a quiz but, it wouldn't let me submit it because I have to pay even though I audited it in the beginning... I still went through it and answered all the questions though, here are my Q&A's.

**week four**

Generally in this week I learned how a program uses the computer's memory to store, retrieve and calculate information. I started learning all pythons reserved words like true, false, if, else, return, def, or, etc,.
![reserved words](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412549/66140048-6e1e9600-e5cf-11e9-9e11-e76deb4adb2b.png)

In the first exercise we assigned integers to variables and learned how to use operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc,. I also found out that python automatically uses PEMDAS. These were also listed on the COP 1500 course website

**Voacb**
Variable: memory location used to store a value. The value stored in a variable can be updated by replacing the old value with a new value.
Comments: describes what is going to happen in following code and is also ignored by python. (#)

Then, I learned a lot about string conversions and how you can use functions like int() and float() to convert between strings and integers. Finally I took the chapter 2 quiz, here is my answers

**week five**
In this section we moved from sequential code that simply runs one line of code after another to conditional code where some steps are skipped.

**Vocab**
boolean expressions: asks questions that produce a Yes/No or True/False result which we use to control program flow.

comparison operators:
![comparison operators](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54412549/66151006-6d442f00-e5e4-11e9-96fa-05728aff6e23.png)
I found this exercise very helpful because it uses nested statements to produce an output and it easily shows the inner and outer loops

Something I really liked about this chapter is that fact that in each video lesson they show you how to start your algorithm in visual blocks like we used the first day of class. Then, you can easily translate your visual block to python code. For example,

Lastly I took chapter 3 quiz:
